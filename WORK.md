# Current Work Progress

## Recently Completed Issues ✅

### Issues 201-204 (All Completed)

**Issue 201 - Model Persistence** ✅
- Enhanced model persistence to keep models loaded between inference calls
- Models stay loaded when `in_ctx` is not specified
- Only unload when explicitly requested with specific context parameter
- Improved model matching logic with better debugging
- Fixed method calls to use `load_model_by_id` instead of `load_model`

**Issue 202 - Enhanced Logging** ✅
- Implemented beautiful enhanced logging with emojis and visual separators
- Added comprehensive config logging showing:
  - 🤖 MODEL information
  - 🔧 CONFIG details (maxTokens, temperature)
  - 📏 CONTEXT length when available
  - 📝 PROMPT with character/line counts and smart truncation
- Enhanced prompt logging with truncation for long prompts

**Issue 203 - Model Lookup Fix** ✅
- Fixed model registry lookup to work with both path keys and model IDs
- Enhanced `find_model` method to try exact path match first, then search by ID
- Preserved original JSON structure keyed by path (no data duplication)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing path-based lookups
- No change to registry size - stayed at 75 models

**Issue 204 - Verbose Stats Logging** ✅
- Added comprehensive inference statistics display including:
  - ⚡ Time to first token
  - ⏱️ Total inference time (calculated in client)
  - 🔢 Predicted tokens  
  - 📝 Prompt tokens
  - 🎯 Total tokens
  - 🚀 Tokens/second
  - 🛑 Stop reason
- Eliminated duplicate "Tokens: 0, Time: 11.66s" line at end of output
- Integrated all stats into beautiful formatted section

## Current Work Status

All immediate priority issues have been resolved. The codebase now has:

1. **Smart Model Management**: Models persist between calls, reducing loading overhead
2. **Beautiful User Interface**: Enhanced logging with comprehensive statistics and visual formatting
3. **Robust Model Lookup**: Works with both paths and IDs without breaking existing functionality
4. **Complete Visibility**: Full inference statistics in verbose mode

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should shift to the items outlined in the updated PLAN.md:

### High Priority Next
1. **Issue #105 - Adam.toml Simplification**: Flatten TOML structure and add --text/--text_file parameters
2. **Context Testing Streamlining**: Simplify ContextTester class methods
3. **Model Loading Optimization**: Further improve reuse detection and feedback

### Development Approach
- Focus on user experience improvements
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Prioritize code simplification and maintainability
- Ensure comprehensive testing of all changes

## Quality Metrics Achieved

- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with beautiful logging
- ✅ Improved performance through model persistence
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging information
- ✅ No regression in existing CLI commands
- ✅ Maintained registry data integrity
