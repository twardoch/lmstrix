# Work Progress

## Completed: MVP Core Functionality

### Summary of Work Completed (2025-07-24)

Successfully implemented the core functionality for LMStrix v1.0 MVP focused on solving the critical problem with LM Studio models falsely declaring higher context limits than they can handle.

### Completed Items

1. **System Path Detection** ✓
   - Implemented LM Studio data directory detection
   - Created lmstrix data directory structure  
   - Updated model registry to use proper paths

2. **Context Testing Engine** ✓
   - Created ContextTester class with binary search algorithm
   - Implemented simulated model loading with context size
   - Added binary search for max loadable context
   - Implemented simple prompt testing ("2+2=")
   - Created per-model logging system

3. **Model Management** ✓
   - Updated Model class with context testing fields
   - Added ContextTestStatus enum
   - Refactored ModelRegistry with save/load functionality
   - Created ModelScanner for automatic discovery

4. **CLI Interface** ✓
   - `lmstrix scan` - Scan for models
   - `lmstrix list` - List models with test status
   - `lmstrix test <model>` - Test specific model
   - `lmstrix test --all` - Test all untested models  
   - `lmstrix status` - Show testing progress
   - Added rich formatting and progress indicators

5. **Package Configuration** ✓
   - Created comprehensive pyproject.toml
   - Fixed all linting issues
   - Formatted code with ruff

### Architecture Implemented

- Data stored in LM Studio directory: `{lmstudio_path}/lmstrix/`
- Model registry: `{lmstudio_path}/lmsm.json` or `{lmstudio_path}/lmstrix/models.json`
- Test logs: `{lmstudio_path}/lmstrix/context_tests/{model_id}_context_test.log`
- Backward compatible with existing lmsm.json format

### Ready for Testing

The MVP is now ready for:
1. Local installation: `pip install -e .`
2. Model scanning: `lmstrix scan`
3. Context testing: `lmstrix test --all`

### Next Priority Tasks

1. Write unit tests for core functionality
2. Test with real LM Studio instance
3. Package and publish to PyPI
4. Create user documentation
