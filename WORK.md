# Work Progress

## Current Work Session - Sort Options for List Command

### Added Sort Options to `lmstrix list`
- Added `--sort` parameter with options: `id`, `idd`, `ctx`, `ctxd`, `dtx`, `dtxd`, `size`, `sized`
- `d` suffix means descending order (e.g., `idd` sorts by ID descending)
- Default sort is by `id` (ascending)
- Sort options:
  - `id`/`idd`: Sort by model ID alphabetically
  - `ctx`/`ctxd`: Sort by tested context size (models without tested context treated as 0)
  - `dtx`/`dtxd`: Sort by declared context limit
  - `size`/`sized`: Sort by model file size
- Invalid sort options show error message and fall back to default

### Implementation Details
- Modified `list()` method in `src/lmstrix/cli/main.py`
- Added sort parameter parsing and reverse flag detection
- Implemented sorting logic for each option
- Maintained backward compatibility (default behavior unchanged)

## Completed Work Session - Issue #201 Enhanced Context Testing Strategy

### Overview
Implemented a safer and more efficient context testing strategy that:
1. Prevents system crashes from attempting very large context sizes
2. Optimizes multi-model testing to minimize repeated loading/unloading
3. Provides better progress visibility with tabular output

### Summary of Changes

1. **CLI Enhancement**:
   - Added `--threshold` parameter to `lmstrix test` command (default: 102,400)
   - Prevents system crashes by limiting maximum test size
   
2. **Algorithm Improvements**:
   - New test sequence: 1024 → min(threshold, declared_max)
   - If success and below declared max: increment by 10,240 until failure
   - If failure: binary search between last good and failed size
   - Clear phase indicators for better user feedback
   
3. **Batch Testing Optimization**:
   - Created `test_all_models()` method for efficient multi-model testing
   - Models sorted by declared context size to minimize loading
   - Pass-based approach: all models tested at each size before moving up
   - Failed models excluded from subsequent passes
   
4. **Output Improvements**:
   - Rich table output for `--all` flag showing results and efficiency
   - Pass-based progress indicators during testing
   - Final summary with success/failure counts
   
5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated usage.md with --threshold examples
   - Updated how-it-works.md with new algorithm explanation
   - Added changelog entry for v1.1 features

### Completed Tasks

1. **Add --threshold parameter to CLI** ✓
   - Added parameter with default value: 102,400 tokens
   - Controls maximum initial test size
   - Prevents crashes from testing 1M+ context sizes
   - Passed to test_model as max_context parameter

2. **Refactor testing algorithm** ✓
   - Implemented new test sequence: 1024 → min(threshold, declared_max)
   - If success and threshold < declared_max: increment by 10,240
   - If failure: binary search downwards
   - Progress saved after each test
   - Clear phase indicators (Phase 1-4)

3. **Implement batch testing for --all** ✓
   - Created test_all_models() method
   - Models sorted by declared context (ascending)
   - Pass-based testing minimizes loading overhead
   - Failed models excluded from subsequent passes
   - Progress persisted between passes

4. **Improve output format** ✓
   - Added Rich table output for --all flag
   - Shows: Model, Status, Optimal Context, Declared Limit, Efficiency
   - Pass-based progress indicators
   - Final summary statistics

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**: The implementation is complete and ready for testing with actual models
2. **Version Bump**: Consider bumping version to v1.1.0 for this significant feature addition
3. **Release**: After testing, create a new release with the enhanced testing strategy

### Implementation Order
1. First: Add --threshold parameter to CLI
2. Second: Refactor test_model() for new algorithm
3. Third: Create test_all_models() for batch testing
4. Fourth: Update output formatting
5. Finally: Update tests and documentation

## Previous Work Session - Issue #107 Enhanced Verbose Output

### Completed Tasks

1. **Enhanced Verbose Logging** (Issue #107) ✓
   - Created new logging utility module at `src/lmstrix/utils/logging.py`
   - Implemented `setup_logging()` function that configures loguru based on verbose flag
   - Updated all CLI commands (scan, list, test, infer) to use setup_logging
   - Added verbose flag to ContextTester constructor
   - Verbose mode now shows:
     - DEBUG level messages with file/function/line info
     - Detailed context loading operations
     - Binary search progress with iterations and search space
     - Model loading/unloading status
     - Inference results and response lengths
     - Progress percentages and estimated iterations
     - Test phase indicators (Phase 1: verification, Phase 2: binary search)
     - Final test results with efficiency metrics

2. **Improved Progress Reporting** ✓
   - Added iteration counter and progress percentage
   - Shows current search range and remaining tokens
   - Displays estimated iterations using log2 calculation
   - Reports when model loads successfully, fails to load, or fails inference
   - Shows response lengths and snippets in verbose mode
   - Displays final efficiency as percentage of declared limit

3. **Better User Experience** ✓
   - Clear phase separation: initial verification vs. binary search
   - Informative messages about what's happening at each step
   - Progress indicators showing how close to completion
   - Final summary with all relevant metrics

### Technical Changes

1. **New File: `src/lmstrix/utils/logging.py`**:
   - Configures loguru with appropriate format and level
   - Verbose mode: DEBUG level with detailed format including file/function/line
   - Normal mode: INFO level with simple time and message format

2. **Updated `src/lmstrix/cli/main.py`**:
   - All commands now call `setup_logging(verbose=verbose)`
   - Passes verbose flag to ContextTester

3. **Enhanced `src/lmstrix/core/context_tester.py`**:
   - Added verbose parameter to constructor
   - Added detailed logging throughout the testing process
   - Special [Context Test], [Phase 1/2], [Binary Search], [Iteration N], and [Test Complete] prefixes
   - Shows token counts with thousand separators
   - Reports efficiency metrics at completion
