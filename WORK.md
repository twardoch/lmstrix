# Work Progress

## Current Work Session - Issue #106 Improvements

### Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Terminology Issues** (Issue #105) ✓
   - Changed "Loaded X models" to "Read X models" in log messages
   - Updated both models.py and model_loader.py
   - Avoids confusion with LM Studio's model loading functionality

2. **Improved Error Messages** ✓
   - Replaced generic "Check logs for details" with specific error messages
   - Now shows actual error: e.g., "Failed: Model not found"
   - Much more helpful for debugging

3. **Fixed Rapid Load/Unload Issues** (Issue #106) ✓
   - Added 0.5s delays before loading and after unloading models
   - Prevents rapid cycling that was causing connection resets
   - Added better logging to show binary search progress

4. **Implemented Smart Context Testing** (Issue #106) ✓
   - Changed from "2+2=" test to "Say hello" for better reliability
   - Start with small context (32) to verify model loads
   - Extended Model data structure to track:
     - last_known_good_context
     - last_known_bad_context
   - Test can now resume from previous state if interrupted
   - Progress is saved after each test iteration

5. **Enhanced Binary Search Algorithm** ✓
   - First tests with minimal context to ensure model loads
   - If previous test was interrupted, resumes from last known state
   - Saves progress to JSON after each test
   - Tracks both working context and loadable context separately

### Technical Changes

1. **Model.py Changes**:
   - Added `last_known_good_context` field
   - Added `last_known_bad_context` field
   - Updated `to_registry_dict()` to include new fields

2. **ContextTester Changes**:
   - Changed test prompt from "2+2=" to "Say hello"
   - Changed validation to check if "hello" is in response (case-insensitive)
   - Complete rewrite of `test_model()` method:
     - Accepts registry parameter for saving progress
     - Starts with context 32 instead of 2048
     - Saves after each test iteration
     - Can resume from previous test state

3. **CLI Changes**:
   - Updated to pass registry to test_model()
   - Shows specific error messages instead of generic ones

### Next Steps

The improvements requested in Issue #106 have been implemented. The testing system now:
- Starts with a small context to verify the model loads
- Uses a simple "Say hello" prompt that's more reliable
- Saves progress after each test so it can resume if interrupted
- Uses a smart binary search that tracks both good and bad context sizes
- Provides clear error messages and progress indicators

The code is ready for testing with actual models.
