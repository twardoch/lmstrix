# Work Progress

## Current Work Session - Issue #107 Enhanced Verbose Output

### Completed Tasks

1. **Enhanced Verbose Logging** (Issue #107) ✓
   - Created new logging utility module at `src/lmstrix/utils/logging.py`
   - Implemented `setup_logging()` function that configures loguru based on verbose flag
   - Updated all CLI commands (scan, list, test, infer) to use setup_logging
   - Added verbose flag to ContextTester constructor
   - Verbose mode now shows:
     - DEBUG level messages with file/function/line info
     - Detailed context loading operations
     - Binary search progress with iterations and search space
     - Model loading/unloading status
     - Inference results and response lengths
     - Progress percentages and estimated iterations
     - Test phase indicators (Phase 1: verification, Phase 2: binary search)
     - Final test results with efficiency metrics

2. **Improved Progress Reporting** ✓
   - Added iteration counter and progress percentage
   - Shows current search range and remaining tokens
   - Displays estimated iterations using log2 calculation
   - Reports when model loads successfully, fails to load, or fails inference
   - Shows response lengths and snippets in verbose mode
   - Displays final efficiency as percentage of declared limit

3. **Better User Experience** ✓
   - Clear phase separation: initial verification vs. binary search
   - Informative messages about what's happening at each step
   - Progress indicators showing how close to completion
   - Final summary with all relevant metrics

### Technical Changes

1. **New File: `src/lmstrix/utils/logging.py`**:
   - Configures loguru with appropriate format and level
   - Verbose mode: DEBUG level with detailed format including file/function/line
   - Normal mode: INFO level with simple time and message format

2. **Updated `src/lmstrix/cli/main.py`**:
   - All commands now call `setup_logging(verbose=verbose)`
   - Passes verbose flag to ContextTester

3. **Enhanced `src/lmstrix/core/context_tester.py`**:
   - Added verbose parameter to constructor
   - Added detailed logging throughout the testing process
   - Special [Context Test], [Phase 1/2], [Binary Search], [Iteration N], and [Test Complete] prefixes
   - Shows token counts with thousand separators
   - Reports efficiency metrics at completion

## Previous Work Session - Issue #106 Improvements

### Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Terminology Issues** (Issue #105) ✓
   - Changed "Loaded X models" to "Read X models" in log messages
   - Updated both models.py and model_loader.py
   - Avoids confusion with LM Studio's model loading functionality

2. **Improved Error Messages** ✓
   - Replaced generic "Check logs for details" with specific error messages
   - Now shows actual error: e.g., "Failed: Model not found"
   - Much more helpful for debugging

3. **Fixed Rapid Load/Unload Issues** (Issue #106) ✓
   - Added 0.5s delays before loading and after unloading models
   - Prevents rapid cycling that was causing connection resets
   - Added better logging to show binary search progress

4. **Implemented Smart Context Testing** (Issue #106) ✓
   - Changed from "2+2=" test to "Say hello" for better reliability
   - Start with small context (128) to verify model loads
   - Extended Model data structure to track:
     - last_known_good_context
     - last_known_bad_context
   - Test can now resume from previous state if interrupted
   - Progress is saved after each test iteration

5. **Enhanced Binary Search Algorithm** ✓
   - First tests with minimal context to ensure model loads
   - If previous test was interrupted, resumes from last known state
   - Saves progress to JSON after each test
   - Tracks both working context and loadable context separately

### Technical Changes

1. **Model.py Changes**:
   - Added `last_known_good_context` field
   - Added `last_known_bad_context` field
   - Updated `to_registry_dict()` to include new fields

2. **ContextTester Changes**:
   - Changed test prompt from "2+2=" to "Say hello"
   - Changed validation to check if "hello" is in response (case-insensitive)
   - Complete rewrite of `test_model()` method:
     - Accepts registry parameter for saving progress
     - Starts with context 128 instead of 2048
     - Saves after each test iteration
     - Can resume from previous test state

3. **CLI Changes**:
   - Updated to pass registry to test_model()
   - Shows specific error messages instead of generic ones

### Next Steps

The verbose output enhancement requested in Issue #107 has been implemented. The `lmstrix test` command with `--verbose` flag now provides:
- Detailed progress information during context testing
- Clear phase indicators
- Model loading/unloading status
- Binary search iterations with progress percentages
- Final efficiency metrics

The code is ready for testing with actual models.
