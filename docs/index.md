# LMStrix: The Unofficial Toolkit for Mastering LM Studio

LMStrix is a professional, installable Python toolkit designed to supercharge your interaction with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/). It provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) and a clean Python API for managing, testing, and running local language models, with a standout feature: the **Adaptive Context Optimizer**.

## Why LMStrix? The Problem it Solves

Working with local LLMs via LM Studio is powerful, but it comes with challenges:

1.  **The Context Window Mystery**: What's the *true* maximum context a model can handle on your machine? Advertised context lengths are often theoretical. The practical limit depends on your hardware, the model's architecture, and LM Studio's own overhead. Finding this limit manually is a tedious, frustrating process of trial and error.
2.  **Repetitive Workflows**: Managing models, crafting prompts, and running inference often involves repetitive boilerplate code or manual steps in the LM Studio UI.
3.  **Lack of Programmatic Control**: The UI is great for exploration, but developers building applications on top of local LLMs need a robust, scriptable interface for automation and integration.

LMStrix solves these problems by providing a seamless, developer-friendly toolkit that automates the tedious parts and lets you focus on building.

## How It Works: The Adaptive Context Optimizer

The core innovation in LMStrix is its ability to **automatically discover the maximum operational context length** for any model loaded in LM Studio.

It uses a sophisticated **binary search algorithm**:
1.  It starts with a wide range for the possible context size.
2.  It sends a specially crafted prompt to the model, progressively increasing the amount of "filler" text.
3.  It analyzes the model's response (or lack thereof) to see if it successfully processed the context.
4.  By repeatedly narrowing the search range, it quickly pinpoints the precise token count where the model's performance degrades or fails.

This gives you a reliable, empirical measurement of the model's true capabilities on your specific hardware, eliminating guesswork and ensuring your applications run with optimal performance.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Context Optimization**: Discover the true context limit of any model with the `optimize` command.
- **Full Model Management**: Programmatically `list` available models and `scan` for newly downloaded ones.
- **Flexible Inference Engine**: Run inference with a powerful two-phase prompt templating system that separates prompt structure from its content.
- **Rich CLI**: A beautiful and intuitive command-line interface built with `rich` and `fire`, providing formatted tables, progress indicators, and clear feedback.
- **Modern Python API**: An `async`-first API designed for high-performance, concurrent applications.
- **Robust and Resilient**: Features automatic retries with exponential backoff for network requests and a comprehensive exception hierarchy.
- **Lightweight and Focused**: Built with a minimal set of modern, high-quality dependencies.
