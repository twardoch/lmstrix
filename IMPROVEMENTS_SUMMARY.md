# LMStrix Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### Issue #105 - Terminology Confusion
- **Problem**: Using "Loaded X models" in logs was confusing since "loading" has a specific meaning in LM Studio
- **Solution**: Changed to "Read X models from..." to clarify we're reading from the JSON registry file

### Issue #106 - Context Testing Improvements
- **Problems**:
  1. Rapid model load/unload causing connection resets
  2. Generic error messages not helpful
  3. Tests starting with large context (2048) even if model can't load
  4. No progress saving - tests restart from beginning if interrupted
  5. Using "2+2=" prompt which might fail with some models

- **Solutions**:
  1. Added 0.5s delays before load and after unload operations
  2. Replaced "Check logs for details" with actual error messages
  3. Tests now start with small context (32) to verify model loads
  4. Added progress tracking fields (last_known_good_context, last_known_bad_context)
  5. Changed prompt to "Say hello" which is more universally supported
  6. Tests save progress after each iteration and can resume if interrupted

## Technical Changes

### 1. Model Data Structure (`src/lmstrix/core/models.py`)
```python
# Added fields for resumable testing
last_known_good_context: int | None
last_known_bad_context: int | None
```

### 2. Context Tester (`src/lmstrix/core/context_tester.py`)
- Changed test prompt from "2+2=" to "Say hello"
- Changed expected response from "4" to "hello" (case-insensitive substring match)
- Complete rewrite of `test_model()` method:
  - Accepts registry parameter for saving progress
  - Starts with context 32 instead of 2048
  - Tests basic functionality before binary search
  - Saves progress after each test iteration
  - Can resume from previous test state
  - Better error handling and logging

### 3. CLI Improvements (`src/lmstrix/cli/main.py`)
- Shows specific error messages instead of generic "Check logs"
- Passes registry to test_model() for progress saving

## Benefits

1. **More Reliable Testing**: Starting with small context ensures we don't waste time on models that can't load
2. **Resumable Tests**: If a test crashes or is interrupted, it can resume from where it left off
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages and progress indicators
4. **More Stable**: Delays prevent rapid operations that cause connection issues
5. **Universal Compatibility**: "Say hello" prompt works with more models than math problems

## Testing Status

The code has been implemented and basic validation shows:
- New fields are properly serialized to JSON
- Prompt validation works correctly ("hello" is found in "Hello! How can I help you today?")
- Error messages are now specific and helpful

## Next Steps

1. **Update Unit Tests**: The existing tests use the old API (optimize_model, find_optimal_context) and need updating
2. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual LM Studio models to verify improvements work in practice
3. **Documentation**: Update user documentation to reflect new testing behavior
4. **Consider Additional Features**:
   - Custom test prompts via CLI
   - Multiple prompt validation for robustness
   - Visual progress bar
   - GPU memory monitoring during tests
