# LMStrix Development Plan - v1.1 Release

## 1. Project Vision & Status

**Vision**: Deliver a reliable, installable tool that solves the critical problem of models in LM Studio declaring false context limits. The tool provides automated discovery of true operational context limits.

**Current Status**: Core CLI enhancements completed. Primary focus on Issue #201 - Enhanced context testing strategy implementation to prevent system crashes and optimize multi-model testing performance.

## 2. Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (COMPLETED)
- âœ“ System path detection and data storage
- âœ“ Context testing engine with binary search
- âœ“ Model management and registry
- âœ“ CLI interface with all commands
- âœ“ Package configuration

### Phase 2: Testing & Quality Assurance (COMPLETED)
- âœ“ Comprehensive unit tests with mocking
- âœ“ Integration tests for all components
- âœ“ Edge case testing for binary search logic
- âœ“ Type checking with mypy
- âœ“ Linting with ruff

### Phase 3: Documentation (COMPLETED)
- âœ“ Updated README with comprehensive guide
- âœ“ API documentation with docstrings
- âœ“ Examples directory with CLI and Python examples
- âœ“ GitHub Pages documentation site
- âœ“ Changelog maintenance

### Phase 3.5: CLI Enhancements (COMPLETED)
- âœ“ Issue #204: Removed all asyncio dependencies, now fully synchronous
- âœ“ Added `--sort` option to `test --all` command matching list command functionality
- âœ“ Added `--ctx` option to work with `test --all` for batch testing at specific context sizes
- âœ“ Added `--show` option to `list` command with multiple output formats (id, path, json)
- âœ“ All show formats respect the sort option for flexible data export
- âœ“ Enhanced model field updates during --ctx testing with proper persistence

## 3. Phase 4: Enhanced Context Testing (LARGELY COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Implement safer and more efficient context testing strategy per Issue #201.

### 3.1. Implementation Status

âœ… **--threshold Parameter (COMPLETED)**
   - âœ“ Added to CLI test command with default 102,400
   - âœ“ Controls maximum initial test size to prevent crashes
   - âœ“ Integrated with min(threshold, declared_max) logic

âœ… **Multi-Model Testing Infrastructure (COMPLETED)**
   - âœ“ `test_all_models()` method implemented in ContextTester
   - âœ“ Pass-based testing approach for efficiency
   - âœ“ Progress persistence between model tests
   - âœ“ Rich table output showing test results with efficiency percentages

âœ… **Output Improvements (COMPLETED)**
   - âœ“ Rich tables for final results summary
   - âœ“ Model ID, Status, Optimal Context, Declared Limit, Efficiency columns
   - âœ“ Clean progress indicators during batch testing

ðŸ”„ **Remaining Tasks for Full Issue #201 Implementation**
   - [ ] Review and optimize the incremental testing algorithm (currently uses threshold-based approach)
   - [ ] Validate that binary search logic handles edge cases efficiently
   - [ ] Add performance benchmarking to measure testing efficiency improvements
   - [ ] Update documentation to reflect the enhanced testing strategy

## 4. Phase 5: Package & Release (READY)

**Goal**: Release LMStrix v1.1.0 to PyPI with enhanced CLI features and testing capabilities.

### 4.1. Pre-Release Checklist
   - âœ“ Core functionality stable and tested
   - âœ“ CLI enhancements completed (--sort, --ctx, --show)
   - âœ“ Asyncio removal completed (Issue #204)
   - âœ“ Enhanced context testing largely implemented (Issue #201)
   - [ ] Final validation testing with real models
   - [ ] Documentation updates for new features

### 4.2. Release Steps

1. **Git Tag Creation**
   - Create annotated tag `v1.1.0` with release message highlighting CLI enhancements
   - Push tag to GitHub repository

2. **Package Building**
   - Run `python -m build` to create distribution packages
   - Verify wheel and sdist files are created correctly

3. **PyPI Publication**
   - Use `twine upload dist/*` to publish to PyPI
   - Ensure package metadata reflects v1.1.0

4. **Post-Release Verification**
   - Test installation: `pip install lmstrix`
   - Verify all CLI commands work, especially new --sort, --ctx, --show options
   - Test Python API imports

5. **GitHub Release**
   - Create GitHub release from v1.1.0 tag
   - Include comprehensive release notes
   - Highlight CLI enhancements and performance improvements

### 4.3. Release Notes Summary

**LMStrix v1.1.0 - Enhanced CLI & Performance Release**

Major Enhancements:
- **Enhanced CLI Functionality**: Added --sort, --ctx, and --show options for flexible model management
