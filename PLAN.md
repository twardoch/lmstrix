# LMStrix Development Plan - v1.0 Next Steps

## 1. Project Vision & Status

**Vision**: Deliver a reliable, installable tool that solves the critical problem of models in LM Studio declaring false context limits. The tool provides automated discovery of true operational context limits.

**Current Status**: The core functionality is complete. The project has been successfully refactored to use the native `lmstudio` package for all model interactions, and all data is stored in the correct, centralized location. The CLI and Python API are functional.

The immediate next steps are to build a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and to prepare the package for its initial public release.

## 2. Phase 2: Testing & Quality Assurance

This phase focuses on ensuring the existing codebase is robust, reliable, and free of bugs.

### 2.1. Unit & Integration Testing
**Goal**: Achieve comprehensive test coverage for all critical components.

- **Testing Framework**: Tests have been implemented using `pytest`.
- **Mocking**: The `pytest-mock` library is used to create mocks of the `lmstudio` package.

- **Test Implementation Status**:

  - **COMPLETED**: Test directories created (`tests/core`, `tests/loaders`, `tests/utils`)
  - **COMPLETED**: Test files created with initial tests for model loading, path utilities, and scanner functionality
  - **COMPLETED**: Tests for `scan_and_update_registry`, `get_lmstudio_path`, and `get_default_models_file` implemented
  
  - **COMPLETED**: Implemented `test_binary_search_logic` with comprehensive edge cases including:
    - Models that work at all sizes
    - Models that never work
    - Models that load but fail inference
    - Models with specific context limits
    - Models that never load

### 2.2. Functional Tests & Usage Examples
**Goal**: Create comprehensive functional tests and practical usage examples that demonstrate all features of both the CLI and Python package.

**Status: COMPLETED**

- **Examples Directory Structure**: All directories and files have been created:
  - `examples/` - Root directory with comprehensive README.md
    - `cli/` - CLI usage examples (all 3 scripts created)
    - `python/` - Python package usage examples (all 4 scripts created)
    - `prompts/` - Sample prompt files (all 4 TOML files created)
    - `data/` - Sample data files (both files created)
    - `run_all_examples.sh` - Script to execute all examples

- All examples are self-contained, runnable, and include detailed comments
- Examples demonstrate error handling, edge cases, and best practices
- The `run_all_examples.sh` script validates all examples work correctly

## 3. Phase 3: Documentation & Release

**Goal**: Prepare the project for a successful v1.0.0 release on PyPI.

### 3.1. Documentation
- **`README.md`**: Update the README to include a clear, concise quick-start guide, installation instructions, and examples for the new CLI commands (`scan`, `test`, `list`).
- **API Documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings to all public functions and classes, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
- **Examples Documentation**: Add a dedicated `examples/README.md` explaining how to run the examples and what each demonstrates.

### 3.2. Packaging & Release
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Verify that all dependencies, project metadata (version, author, license), and entry points are correct.
- **PyPI Release**: Once testing and documentation are complete, the project will be built and published to PyPI, making it installable via `pip install lmstrix`.
