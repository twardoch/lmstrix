# LMStrix Current Development Plan

## Current Status
Recent issues 201-204 have been completed successfully:
- ✅ Enhanced model persistence and state management
- ✅ Beautiful enhanced logging with comprehensive statistics  
- ✅ Fixed model lookup to work with both paths and IDs
- ✅ Integrated verbose stats display without duplication

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Issue #105 - Adam.toml Simplification
**Priority: High**
- Simplify adam.toml structure to use flat format instead of nested groups
- Add --text and --text_file parameters to infer command for direct text input
- Update all prompt examples to use simplified approach
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing TOML files

### 2. Context Testing Streamlining  
**Priority: Medium**
- Simplify ContextTester class by merging methods into single test_context() function
- Remove complex state management and resumption logic
- Streamline binary search algorithm
- Consolidate test result logging

### 3. Model Loading Optimization
**Priority: Medium**  
- Improve model reuse detection to avoid unnecessary loading messages
- Add context length display in enhanced logging when available
- Optimize model loading workflow for better performance

## Future Development Phases

### Phase A: Core Simplification (2-3 weeks)
1. **Configuration Unification**
   - Create utils/config.py for centralized configuration handling
   - Consolidate path handling functions (get_lmstudio_path, etc.)
   - Remove redundant configuration code

2. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Review and simplify custom exception hierarchy
   - Standardize error messages across codebase
   - Implement consistent logging patterns

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Add comprehensive type hints to public APIs
   - Ensure all functions have proper docstrings
   - Remove deprecated TODO comments from code

### Phase B: CLI Enhancement (1-2 weeks)
1. **Command Improvements**
   - Enhance `scan` command with better progress reporting
   - Improve `list` command with filtering and sorting options
   - Add `reset` command for clearing model test data

2. **User Experience**
   - Better error messages with helpful suggestions
   - Improved help text and documentation
   - Enhanced progress indicators for long-running operations

### Phase C: Testing & Documentation (1 week)
1. **Test Suite Completion**
   - Ensure >90% test coverage maintained
   - Add integration tests for new features
   - Performance benchmarking of improvements

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md with latest features
   - Create comprehensive CLI reference
   - Update examples to demonstrate new capabilities

## Technical Debt Reduction

### Code Architecture
- Review and simplify InferenceManager class structure
- Consolidate duplicate logic across modules
- Improve separation of concerns between CLI and core logic

### Performance Optimization
- Profile model loading and caching behavior
- Optimize JSON registry read/write operations
- Reduce memory usage in context testing

### Dependency Management
- Review and minimize external dependencies
- Ensure compatibility with latest Python versions
- Update build and packaging configuration

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: All existing CLI commands work without regression
- **Performance**: Model loading and inference speed improvements
- **Usability**: Cleaner, more informative user interface
- **Maintainability**: Reduced complexity, better code organization
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date and comprehensive user guides

## Long-term Vision

The goal is to make LMStrix the most user-friendly and efficient tool for managing and testing LM Studio models, with:
- Intuitive CLI interface with beautiful, informative output
- Smart model management with automatic optimization
- Comprehensive testing capabilities with clear results
- Excellent developer experience with clean, well-documented code
