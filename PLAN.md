# LMStrix Development Plan - v1.0 Native `lmstudio` Integration

## 1. Project Vision

**Vision**: LMStrix v1.0 will be a minimal viable product focused on solving the critical problem with LM Studio: many models falsely declare higher maximum context lengths than they can actually handle.

**Core Problem**: LM Studio models often declare context limits (e.g., 128k tokens) that fail in practice. Models may fail to load, produce gibberish, or only work correctly below a certain "real" max context.

**Solution**: LMStrix provides automated testing and validation of true operational context limits using native `lmstudio` package integration for direct and reliable model interaction.

## 2. Core Technical Approach: Native Integration

All core functionality is built directly on top of the `lmstudio` Python package:

- **Model Discovery**: `lmstudio.list_downloaded_models()`
- **Model Loading/Unloading**: `lmstudio.llm()` and `llm.unload()`
- **Model Information**: `llm.get_info()`
- **Inference**: `llm.complete()`
- **Configuration**: Model loading configured with `config={"context_length": size}`

## 3. Completed Features (v1.0.0)

### Major Refactoring Complete
- ✅ Removed `litellm` dependency completely
- ✅ Implemented native `lmstudio` package integration
- ✅ Refactored all core components for direct LM Studio interaction

### Core Components Implemented
- ✅ **API Client**: Direct wrapper around `lmstudio` package functions
- ✅ **Context Tester**: Binary search algorithm for finding true context limits
- ✅ **Inference Engine**: Native model loading with tested context lengths
- ✅ **Model Discovery**: Sync with LM Studio's downloaded models
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Full command set (scan, list, test, infer, status)
- ✅ **Python API**: Clean programmatic interface to all functionality

## 4. Phase 2: Testing, Documentation, and Release

### 4.1. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Cover the core logic for the binary search algorithm, response validation, and registry management
- **Integration Tests**: Write tests that use a mock of the `lmstudio` package to simulate end-to-end workflows without requiring a live LM Studio instance

### 4.2. Documentation
- Update `README.md` to reflect the new `lmstudio`-based approach
- Create a clear guide on the context testing methodology
- Document the CLI commands and Python API

### 4.3. Release
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` is complete and accurate
- Publish v1.0.0 to PyPI

## 5. Future Enhancements (Post v1.0)

- Advanced context optimization algorithms (beyond binary search validation)
- Streaming support for real-time inference
- Multi-model workflow capabilities
- GUI/web interface for easier interaction
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Model comparison features
