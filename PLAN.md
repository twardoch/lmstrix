## 2. Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (COMPLETED)
- ✓ System path detection and data storage
- ✓ Context testing engine with binary search
- ✓ Model management and registry
- ✓ CLI interface with all commands
- ✓ Package configuration

### Phase 2: Testing & Quality Assurance (COMPLETED)
- ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with mocking
- ✓ Integration tests for all components
- ✓ Edge case testing for binary search logic
- ✓ Type checking with mypy
- ✓ Linting with ruff

### Phase 3: Documentation (COMPLETED)
- ✓ Updated README with comprehensive guide
- ✓ API documentation with docstrings
- ✓ Examples directory with CLI and Python examples
- ✓ GitHub Pages documentation site
