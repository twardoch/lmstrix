We need to change the strategy for `lmstrix test`, especially with `--all`

Right now we test an initial context size (1024) and then the maximum declared context size, and then we do some binary search. This is highly problematic because an attempt to load a very large context size like 1 million will crash my system. Therefore, we need to revise it. We need a "--threshold" param defaulting to 102400. We load the model first with 1024, then with threshold or declared max, whatever is SMALLER. If that fails, we do a binary search downwards. If the threshold > declared max and it loaded successfully, we increase by 10240 until we reach the declared max or fail.

When --all is given, we don't load the same model again and again, but instead we go in passes:
- We sort the models by declared max context size increasingly.
- We first load each model at 1024 and do the test inference (and unload all models after loading the model ofc.). We mark the models that failed and exclude from subsequent passes. Then we do the 2nd pass as described above, for each model. Then we do the 3rd pass for each model etc. — until for each model we either reach the declared max or we encounter the first fail. And ofc we record the progress each time.

The `lmstrix list` and `lmstrix scan` produce a nice tabular view.

The `lmstrix test` outputs a rather primitive view. I’d rather that it emitted a SIMILAR view, simply printing a row for every test (without the "live" functionality, simply adding one row per model pass).
