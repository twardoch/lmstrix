I’m struggling to understand why `lmstrix test -c 2047 -m MODEL_ID` fails if MODEL_ID is one of these: 

```

```

Basically the inference from these models fails when called via the code that `lmstrix test` uses. 

But in the LM Studio GUI the inference works. 

Write some code that uses the `lmstrix infer` code but also more direct `lmstudio` code, with just the model `slim-extract-qwen-0.5b` so we can pinpoint the issue.
