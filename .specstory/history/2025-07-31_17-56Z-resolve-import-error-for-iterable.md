# Resolve import error for Iterable (2025-07-31 17:56Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Import from `collections.abc` instead: `Iterable`
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting an error about importing `Iterable` from `typing` instead of `collections.abc`. This is a common issue with newer Python versions where certain typing imports have been moved to `collections.abc`.

Looking at the code, I can see on line 4:
```python
from typing import Any, Iterable    
```

The fix is simple - I need to change this to import `Iterable` from `collections.abc` instead of `typing`. This is the modern way to import `Iterable` in Python 3.9+.

Let me make this concise fix.</details></think>

Looking at the linter error, the issue is that `Iterable` should be imported from `collections.abc` instead of `typing` in modern Python versions. Here's the fix:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>That should fix the import error. The change is simple and follows modern Python best practices:

1. `Iterable` is now imported from `collections.abc` instead of `typing`
2. `Any` remains in `typing` as that's still the correct location for it

This resolves the linter warning about importing from `collections.abc` instead of `typing` for `Iterable`.</details></think>

---

The fix is complete! I've updated the import to use `from collections.abc import Iterable` instead of importing it from `typing`. This follows the modern Python convention where `Iterable` and other abstract base classes should be imported from `collections.abc` rather than `typing`.

`lmstrix infer translate,CAPS --verbose -m llama-3.2-3b-instruct --file_prompt adam.toml --text_file fontlab8a.md --in_ctx 50%`lmstrix

In such case Iâ€™m getting

[I] Loaded prompts from adam.toml lmstrix.loaders.prompt_loader:load_single_prompt:129
[I] Resolved placeholders with TOPL lmstrix.loaders.prompt_loader:load_single_prompt:142
[D] Error loading prompt from file: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'split' lmstrix.api.main:run_inference:648

We need to check if the prompt_name is a str, and we then split on `,`. It may also already be an Interable. In either case, we have an iterable `prompt_names` and then we actually resolve them one by one and then we concatenate the results.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is experiencing an issue where the prompt_name parameter in `load_single_prompt` is expected to be a string or an iterable of strings, but the current code is trying to call `.split()` on what might be a tuple or other iterable.

Looking at the function signature:
```python
def load_single_prompt(
    toml_path: Path,
    prompt_name: str | Iterable[str],
    resolver: PromptResolver | None = None,
    verbose: bool = False,
    **params: str,
) -> ResolvedPrompt:
```

The function accepts either a string or an iterable of strings, but the current implementation seems to assume it's always a string and tries to split it.

From the command line usage: `translate,CAPS` - this suggests the user is passing a comma-separated string that should be split into multiple prompt names, and then each should be resolved individually and concatenated.

I need to:
1. Check if prompt_name is a string, and if so, split it on commas
2. If it's already an iterable, use it as-is
3. Resolve each prompt individually
4. Concatenate the results

Let me look at the current code and see where the issue is occurring. The error suggests there's a `.split()` call on a tuple, which means somewhere in the code we're trying to split a non-string.

Looking at the linter errors, I can see that on line 152, there's an error about the prompt_name type being incompatible with the expected string type for `resolve_prompt`. This suggests that `resolve_prompt` expects only a single string, not an iterable.

So the fix should be:
1. In `load_single_prompt`, handle the case where prompt_name is a string (split on comma) or already an iterable
2. Resolve each prompt name individually using `resolve_prompt`
3. Concatenate the resolved prompts somehow

But wait, the return type is `ResolvedPrompt`, not a list. 

I'll need a strategy to merge multiple resolved prompts into a single `ResolvedPrompt` object. This might involve combining their text, messages, or other attributes in a meaningful way.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue! The `load_single_prompt` function accepts `str | Iterable[str]` but then tries to pass it directly to `resolve_prompt` which only accepts a single string. We need to handle the case where multiple prompt names are provided (either as a comma-separated string or as an iterable) and resolve them individually, then concatenate the results.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've implemented the fix for the `load_single_prompt` function. Here's what the fix does:

1. **Handle different input types**: It checks if `prompt_name` is a string, and if so, splits it on commas and strips whitespace. If it's already an iterable, it converts it to a list.

2. **Resolve each prompt individually**: It loops through each prompt name and resolves them one by one using `resolver.resolve_prompt()`.

3. **Concatenate results**: If there's only one prompt, it returns that. If there are multiple prompts, it combines their system and user messages by joining them with double newlines.

4. **Handle unresolved placeholders**: It collects all unresolved placeholders from all resolved prompts.

5. **Proper logging**: It logs each individual prompt resolution and also logs when multiple prompts are combined.

This should fix the error the user was experiencing with `translate,CAPS` where the code was trying to call `.split()` on a tuple. Now it properly handles both comma-separated strings and iterables of strings.

Let me check for any linting errors that might have been introduced.</details></think>

---

The fix is now complete! Here's what I've implemented:

1. **Input handling**: The function now properly detects if `prompt_name` is a string (which it splits on commas) or already an iterable (which it converts to a list).

2. **Individual resolution**: Each prompt name is resolved separately using `resolver.resolve_prompt()`.

3. **Concatenation**: If multiple prompts are provided, their system and user messages are combined with double newlines between them.

4. **Placeholder tracking**: All unresolved placeholders from all prompts are collected and included in the final result.

This should fix the error you were seeing with `translate,CAPS` where the code was trying to call `.split()` on a tuple. Now it will properly handle:
- Single prompt: `"translate"`
- Comma-separated prompts: `"translate,CAPS"`
- Already split iterables: `["translate", "CAPS"]`

The resolved prompts will be concatenated together into a single `ResolvedPrompt` object with combined system and user messages.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I see the issue! The `ResolvedPrompt` class has these fields:
- `name: str`
- `template: str` (original template)
- `resolved: str` (resolved prompt text)
- `tokens: int`
- `placeholders_found: list[str]`
- `placeholders_resolved: list[str]`
- `placeholders_unresolved: list[str]`

It doesn't have `system_message` and `user_message` attributes. The resolved prompt text is just in the `resolved` field.

So when I'm combining multiple prompts, I should be combining their `resolved` text instead of trying to access non-existent `system_message` and `user_message` attributes.

Perfect! The fix is now complete. Here's a summary of what I've resolved:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Fixed the root issue**: The `load_single_prompt` function now properly handles `prompt_name` being either:
   - A comma-separated string like `"translate,CAPS"`
   - An iterable like `["translate", "CAPS"]`

2. **Corrected ResolvedPrompt usage**: Instead of trying to access non-existent `system_message` and `user_message` attributes, the code now properly uses:
   - `resolved` field for the final resolved prompt text
   - `template` field for the original template
   - Proper constructor parameters: `name`, `tokens`, `placeholders_found`, etc.

3. **Proper concatenation logic**: Multiple prompts are combined by:
   - Joining their `resolved` text with double newlines
   - Combining their templates, names, and placeholder tracking
   - Summing token counts

4. **Code cleanup**: Removed redundant import and fixed line length issues.

## How it works now:

When you run:
```bash
lmstrix infer translate,CAPS --verbose -m llama-3.2-3b-instruct --file_prompt adam.toml --text_file fontlab8a.md --in_ctx 50%
```

The function will:
1. Split `"translate,CAPS"` into `["translate", "CAPS"]`
2. Resolve each prompt individually
3. Combine their resolved text into a single `ResolvedPrompt` object
4. Return the combined result for inference

This should fix the `'ResolvedPrompt' object has no attribute 'system_message'` error you were experiencing.
