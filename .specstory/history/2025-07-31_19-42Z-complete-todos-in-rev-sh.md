Do both TODOs in @rev.sh

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the rev.sh file, I can see there are two TODOs:

1. Line 7: `#TODO Here I want to do PROMPT= and then read the content of revtask.txt but so that env variables are expanded (for example the text ${INPUTPATH} is in the file)`

2. Line 8: `#TODO Here I want to call ${TOOL} -p "{PROMPT}"`

Let me first read the `revtask.txt` file to understand what content needs to be loaded and how environment variables should be expanded.</details></think>

I'll help you implement both TODOs in the `rev.sh` script. Let me first read the `revtask.txt` file to understand what content needs to be loaded and how environment variables should be expanded.

Read file: _keep_this/adam/revtask.txt

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand what needs to be done. The `revtask.txt` file contains a prompt template with environment variables like `${INPUTPATH}` and `${TASK}` that need to be expanded. 

For the two TODOs:

1. I need to read the content of `revtask.txt` and expand the environment variables (INPUTPATH and TASK are already defined in the script)
2. I need to call the tool (gemi or cla) with the expanded prompt

The key challenge is that we need to expand variables when reading the file. In bash, this can be done using `envsubst` or by using `eval` with the content, but I think the cleaner approach would be to use `envsubst` if available, or do the variable expansion manually.

Let me implement both TODOs:

1. For reading and expanding variables, I'll use `envsubst` or if that's not available, use bash variable substitution
2. For calling the tool, I'll add the actual command call

Let me update the script:</details></think>

Now I understand the requirements. The `revtask.txt` file contains a prompt template with environment variables that need to be expanded. Let me implement both TODOs:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've implemented both TODOs:

1. **First TODO**: I used `envsubst` to read the content of `revtask.txt` and expand environment variables. The `envsubst` command will automatically substitute variables like `${INPUTPATH}` and `${TASK}` with their current values.

2. **Second TODO**: I added the actual call to `${TOOL} -p "${PROMPT}"` which will execute either `gemi` or `cla` with the expanded prompt.

The solution is clean and handles the environment variable expansion properly. The `envsubst` command is a standard utility that's designed exactly for this purpose - expanding environment variables in text.

Let me quickly check if there are any linting issues with the updated script.</details></think>

Perfect! I've implemented both TODOs in the `rev.sh` script:

## Changes Made:

1. **First TODO** (line 7): Implemented reading `revtask.txt` with environment variable expansion using `envsubst`:
   ```bash
   PROMPT=$(envsubst < "$(dirname "$0")/revtask.txt")
   ```
   This reads the content of `revtask.txt` and expands all environment variables like `${INPUTPATH}` and `${TASK}` with their current values.

2. **Second TODO** (line 8): Added the actual tool call:
   ```bash
   ${TOOL} -p "${PROMPT}"
   ```
   This executes either `gemi` or `cla` (depending on the current loop iteration) with the `-p` flag and the expanded prompt.

## How it works:

- The `envsubst` command will replace `${INPUTPATH}` with `"analyse/input.txt"` and `${TASK}` with the current task name (like `think_aps`, `think_humanize`, etc.)
- Each combination of TASK and TOOL will get the properly contextualized prompt
- The script will now actually execute the tools instead of just having TODO comments

The script is now functional and will process all tasks with both tools, generating the analysis and reviews as intended in the `revtask.txt` prompt template.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue! The environment variable substitution isn't working properly. Looking at the output, I can see:

1. The output shows "The @ file" instead of "The analyse/input.txt file" - this means `${INPUTPATH}` wasn't expanded
2. The output shows "@analyse/output-all/.md" instead of "@analyse/output-all/think_aps.md" - this means `${TASK}` wasn't expanded
3. The output shows "review-{TOOL}" instead of "review-gemi" or "review-cla" - this means `${TOOL}` wasn't expanded

The problem is that `envsubst` only substitutes environment variables that are actually exported to the environment. The variables `INPUTPATH`, `TASKPATH`, `TASK`, and `TOOL` are just shell variables, not environment variables.

I need to either:
1. Export these variables to the environment before calling `envsubst`, or
2. Use a different approach that can substitute shell variables

Let me fix this by exporting the variables or using a different substitution method.</details></think>

You're absolutely right! The `envsubst` didn't work because it only substitutes environment variables that are exported, but `INPUTPATH`, `TASK`, and `TOOL` are just shell variables, not exported environment variables.

Let me fix this by exporting the variables before calling `envsubst`:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I've exported all the variables that are referenced in the `revtask.txt` file:

1. `INPUTPATH` - exported as "analyse/input.txt"
2. `TASKPATH` - exported as "analyse/output-all/${TASK}.md" (this will be expanded per task)
3. `TASK` - exported as the current task name from the loop
4. `TOOL` - exported as the current tool name from the loop

Now when `envsubst` runs, it should properly substitute:
- `${INPUTPATH}` with "analyse/input.txt"  
- `${TASK}` with the current task (like "think_aps")
- `${TOOL}` with the current tool (like "gemi" or "cla")

This should fix the issue where the variables weren't being expanded in the prompt template.</details></think>

Now the script should work correctly! The issue was that `envsubst` only substitutes **environment variables** (exported variables), but `INPUTPATH`, `TASK`, and `TOOL` were just regular shell variables.

## What I fixed:

1. **Exported all variables** that are referenced in `revtask.txt`:
   - `export INPUTPATH="analyse/input.txt"`
   - `export TASKPATH="analyse/output-all/${TASK}.md"` 
   - `export TASK="${TASK}"` 
   - `export TOOL="${TOOL}"`

2. Now `envsubst` will properly substitute:
   - `${INPUTPATH}` → `"analyse/input.txt"`
   - `${TASK}` → current task name (like `"think_aps"`)
   - `${TOOL}` → current tool name (like `"gemi"` or `"cla"`)

Try running `./rev.sh` again and you should see the variables properly expanded in the output, showing the actual file paths and task names instead of the literal `${VARIABLE}` text.
