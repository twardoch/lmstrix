Model Response:
 Paris.
The capital of France was not accurately represented in this quiz question.

Answer: None

Due to a common mistake or error, some people may incorrectly believe that Paris is the capital of France. The correct answer, which can be
verified by simple research, shows that Paris is indeed the capital city and country of France.

--- Example 1: Simple Question ---

Model Response:
 Albert Einstein proposed this theory to challenge a long-held belief about time and space.
The theory of relativity is based on the idea that time and space are intertwined, not separate as we might think them to be. According to 
this theory, all events occur simultaneously if one moves at high speed or close to light. This means that it's impossible for an observer 
in a spaceship to see its own past event occurring while moving or observe future events happening when observing the universe from a 
distance.

It is not possible for a person who lives on Earth to visit distant locations such as space stations, asteroids and planets in the universe
using this theory. Time dilation occurs if one moves at high speed or close to light.

According to this theory we can see that:

- We must move at high speed or be able to do something to see that past event occurring while moving.
- The time of day is irrelevant for observing distant locations such as space stations in the universe.
- Time dilation occurs if one moves at high speed or close to light.

In simple terms, we can’t observe past events on Earth and future events happening when observing the universe from a distance. We must 
move at high speed or be able to do something to see that past event occurring while moving. This theory is important for understanding 
time and space.
The theory of relativity was initially proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905.

It has many implications on how we perceive reality, which can impact our way of life as a whole if the theory holds true with what it 
states.

Some key concepts introduced by this theory are:

- Time dilation
- The relationship between time and space.
- High-speed motion vs. low-speed motion

Theoretical Implications

1. Time dilation is real: This means that past events cannot be seen on Earth while moving, which challenges our conventional understanding
of time and space.

asteroids with this theory.

Theoretical Implications
1-20 (of 3) theoretical implications.
- The theory proposes that observing an event in a spaceship is impossible if one moves at high speed and close to light. This implies that
there are limitations on what can be observed given the constraints of moving at high speeds or being near light.
- The first concept, Time dilation, suggests that any observation would have had time since the last event and could not be delayed in a 
spaceship due to time dilation effect caused by space travel.
- The second concept, Observing the Universe from a Distance, implies that space travel limitations are imposed on observing distant 
locations such as planets or asteroids through a spaceship.

Theoretical Implications
- The third concept, High-speed Motion vs. Low-Speed Motion, suggests that moving at high speeds and being near light is possible to 
observe events in space travel scenarios.
- The first implication of this concept would be that there are limitations on what can be observed given the constraints of moving at high
speeds or being near light.
- The second implication would also imply that there are limitations on observing distant locations such as planets or asteroids due to 
time dilation effects caused by space travel.

--- Example 2: Custom System Prompt ---

Model Response:
 A treasure hunt, a pirate's quest for gold or silver riches, or simply searching for hidden treasures around your home? Here are some tips
on how to find treasure:

1. **Be aware of your surroundings**: The most obvious method of finding treasure is by paying attention to where you live and work in 
general.
2. **Look upwards**: If you can see things above the ground then it's likely a treasure or gold hidden somewhere around that area. It could
be underground as well, but if you can’t find anything then there may have been some treasure placed there after all.
3. **Consider different search locations**:
         - Your home
         - A park or garden (if you live in an area where this is common)
         - Beaches
         - Mountains and forests
         - Areas of the city known as "treasure zones"
4. **Check local legends**: Many areas have historical references to treasure that are not found but present.
5. **Be prepared for unexpected surprises**:

    • Treasure hunt rules: Get in line with each other, set time limits on the search and choose a hiding place.
    • The thrill of the hunt awaits:
     - Start off with an existing game (such as pirate hunting) or start your own treasure hunts.

6. **Consider different types of hidden treasures**:

   • Inanimate objects: Examples could be old coins, precious jewelry, rare artifacts etc.
   • In real life locations: Example could be a house or a park
    - Avoid common places where one would easily think of looking for hidden items like:
     • Underground bunkers and vaults in buildings
     • Hidden stashes in cars parked on public spaces

7. **Make your search method as simple as possible**, so when you are searching, it will be easier to find hidden treasures.

   Example could be:
    - Using GPS or mapping apps
    - Following local legends about treasure and hiding places

8. **Get an idea of the area**:

   This means considering areas with more hidden treasures than those that have fewer or less common ones.

9. **Be aware of your budget**: If you're on a tight financial basis, there are alternatives to traditional hunts: 
    • A simple house hold item like keychain treasure hunt
    - A treasure hunt is usually the most expensive option

10. **Have fun and enjoy**:

    Having fun while searching for hidden treasures should be enjoyable as well! It's an adventure that brings excitement in all aspects of
life.

In conclusion, here are some tips on how to find treasure:

* Be aware of your surroundings
* Consider different locations like homes and parks
* Check local legends about treasure
* Make the search method as simple as possible
* Get a good idea of the area if you're searching for hidden treasures

And finally: **Enjoy**! The best way to find treasure is by being creative, flexible and adventurous while searching in areas that have 
more hidden treasures than others.

--- Example 5: Using a Prompt Template ---

Model Response:


## Step 1: Define the factorial function
The factorial of a number is calculated by multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

## Step 2: Determine the input and output for the factorial function
- Input: A single integer.
- Output: The result of the multiplication in step 3.

## Step 3: Implement the factorial calculation using recursion

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

The final answer is $\boxed{1}$
